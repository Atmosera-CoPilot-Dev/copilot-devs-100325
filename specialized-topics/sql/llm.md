# Role of an LLM (Programmer View)

- Takes your input, breaks it into tiny pieces (tokens), and predicts the next piece over and over to build a reply.
- Learned patterns from lots of text; it remembers patterns, not real-time or guaranteed facts.
- You guide it with clear prompts and simple settings (temperature etc.) to be more direct or creative.
- Good at summarizing, drafting answers, explaining code, and filling in patterns.
- Limits: can sound confident but be wrong or outdated; not a database or source of truth.
